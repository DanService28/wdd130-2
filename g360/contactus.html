                    <p>The best time to visit the Galapagos Islands depends on your preferences.
                        If you prefer warmer weather and calm seas, the warm/wet season may be 
                        more suitable. If you are interested in observing the unique behaviors
                        of wildlife during different times of the year, you might choose the
                        cool/dry season. However, keep in mind that the Galapagos Islands are 
                        a year-round destination with an incredible variety of wildlife and 
                        landscapes to offer, regardless of the season. You can travel during either
                        of the two seasons, as both provide the opportunity to witness diverse
                        attractions and unique animals.<br>
                        1. Warm/Wet Season (December to May)<br>
                        2. Cool/Dry Season (June to November)

                <button class="accordion">What are the most popular destinations in the Galápagos Islands?</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>The Galápagos Islands feature a range of popular destinations beyond Santa Cruz, Isabela,
                        and San Cristóbal. Islands like Bartolomé, Pinzón, Daphne, and others offer unique experiences.
                        Despite some being more renowned, each island on our tours provides a distinctive and
                        captivating encounter, showcasing the incredible diversity of the Galápagos.

                        while others might incur a cancellation fee. The amount of the refund is often dependent
                        on how far in advance the cancellation is made.
                        If you find yourself in a situation where you need to cancel, please reach out to our customer

                    scheduled further in advance, it's advisable to secure your reservation early,
