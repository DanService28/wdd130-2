                <h2>Main Fork Salomon River</h2>
                <p>From Idaho this river ranges from class I-IV. The Salmon is one of the longest undammed rivers in the 
                    United States. As a free flowing river the water is higher, faster, and colder in 
                    the early summer and lower, slower, and warmer in the late summer. There are good 
                    rapids all summer...but families with children who like to swim tend to appreciate 
                    the late summer's slower, warmer water more.</p>

                <h2>Desolation and Gray Canyon</h2>
                <p>Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of the most desolate land anywhere,
                    the Green river flows towards the mighty Colorado river and the sea. High grey stone
                    cliffs, beautiful desert scenery, and great rapids have made this run famous. This   
                    84-mile trip runs from from Sand Wash to Swaseys Rapid (just outside Green River Utah) 
                    and boasts outstanding scenery, interesting geologic formations, evidence of prehistoric 
                    and historic human activity, and great whitewater opportunities.
                    Desolation is rated a Class II/III and is usually done in 6 days

                <h2>Grand Canyon</h2>
                <p>Grand Canyon river rafting in Arizona combines world-class whitewater with breathtaking scenery
                    to make one truly unforgettable river experience. The canyon is filled not only with 
                    exhilarating whitewater rapids, but with side canyons and ancient indian ruins accessible 
                    only by river.
                    CLASS I - X: The Grand Canyon uses a unique river rating scale. The rapids in the Canyon
                    are technically rated I - X ( 1 - 10) to accommodate such a wide variety of rapids and river
                    variances. However, most people are familiar with the regular I - V river rating scale,
                    so we often refer to both.

                    <p>My rafting experience was absolutely thrilling and full of adrenaline. From the moment 
                        we stepped into the raft, the guide made us feel comfortable and secure, providing clear 
                        instructions. As we navigated down the river, we encountered exhilarating rapids that
                        drenched us and heightened the excitement. The natural beauty along the route was also
                        breathtaking. Rafting is definitely an activity I would recommend to anyone seeking an
                        adventurous thrill amid nature.</p>

                    <p>I took my family for a rafting vacation, and we all had a blast. Despite having young kids,
                        the guide assured us of a safe and enjoyable experience for everyone. The gentler rapids
                        were perfect for the family, and the sense of adventure left the kids excited and wanting
                        more. The company provided all the necessary equipment, and the guide shared interesting
                        anecdotes about the local history and geography. Overall, it was an excellent way to 
                        bond as a family in nature.

                    <h3 class="title-comment">An Unforgettable Adventure: ★★★★☆</h3>
                    <p>Rafting was an unforgettable experience. Interacting with the river's current and 
                        collaborating with fellow rafters created a unique sense of camaraderie. The challenging
                        rapids kept the thrill alive, and the scenic beauty enhanced the overall journey's
                        memorability. The guide team was well-prepared, ensuring everyone had fun safely. 
                        The only reason I don't give it five stars is that I would have liked a bit more information
                        about the local wildlife during the trip.
